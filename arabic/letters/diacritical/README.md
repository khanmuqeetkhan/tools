# Prompt
I want to create a page for my son (9 year old) to be able to recognize arabic letters from the Quran but 
only letters with random of the following 
"kasra, fatha, damma, shadda, two fathas, two damma, two shadda, stretching letters"
Create a html page with javascript and css to show letters each after few seconds.
Use any external library if required but it should not be required to run it on any server.

* The site should look professional.
* The site should be in English.
* The site should be mobile friendly.
* Also add a button to pause for a while.
* Write the correct pronunciation in English.
* Provide a settings panel in the right corner, it should open as a drawer.
* Give an option to control the paus between showing two letters.
* Letters should be shown in random order with random "kasra, fatha, damma, shadda, two fathas, two damma, two shadda, stretching letters".
* Also show an example word from the Quran (it should be only the one that is most well known) for each letter.
* Each letter should have a unique color and the letter should be large and bold. And should occupy most the page.
* * And more features if you want to be more creative.
* It should work when I just copy and paste it in a html file.
