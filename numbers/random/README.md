# Prompt
I want to create a page for my son (2 year old) to be able to recognize numbers. 
He is already good in it and I want to play with him. Create a html page with javascript and css to show numbers after few seconds.  
Use any external library if required but it should not be required to run it on any server.

- The site should look professional.
- Provide a settings panel in the right corner, it should open as a draw.
- Give an option to control the paus between showing two numbers.
- Also it should be configurable to select the range of numbers, default should be 1 - 9.
- Numbers should be shown in sequential order first and there should be an option to show numbers randomly.
- There should be a option to include/exclude zero and be able to select bigger range.
- Each number should have a unique color and the number should be large and bold. And should occupy most the page.
- And it should be configurable to change it to random colors if selected.
- There should be a small music note to be played when the number is first displayed.
- And more features if you want to be more creative.
- It should work when I just copy and paste it in a html file.
- Enhance this by showing few objects on the left, if required move the number part to a bit right. 
  Then use objects like ducks, balls, etc and randomly associate them to each number.
