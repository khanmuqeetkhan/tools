- It should be only two numbers arithematic operation, with advanced options to control the number of numbers for the operation.
- The numbers should be shown randomly, and numbers should not be repeated within a session.
- Provide a settings panel in the right corner, it should open as a draw.
- Also it should be configurable to select the range of numbers, default should be 1 - 9 with the option to select 9 - 19, 1 - 19, 9 - 29, 19 - 29, 1 - 29 an similarly.
- number should be large and bold. And should occupy most the page.

- Enhance this by showing few objects on the left, if required move the number part to a bit right.
