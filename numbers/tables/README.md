# Prompt

- I want to create a page for my kids to be able to recognize (quiz) math tables from x to z.
- Create a html page with javascript and css.
- Use any external library if required but it should not be required to run it on any server.
- User can either choose to learn or play a quiz on tables.
- When playing quiz show math table quiz randomly each after few seconds.  Example:  5 x 5 = ? (answer should be shown only if you click it, it should flip the ? and show the answer instead).
- When choosing learning the chosen table should be printed in the 3 x 1 = 3 until 3 x 12 = 36 (the whole chart) for a selected number from a list of numbers from 1 to 12 or any entered numbers (text field accepting only numbers).
- The site should be in English.
- The site should look professional.
- Provide a settings panel in the right corner, it should open as a drawer.  Here the user can select the range say x-z tables where x can be same number as z or must be higher than x.
- Give an option to control the pause between showing the questions.
- Option to play quiz in sequential order or randomly.
- Each number should have a unique color and the number should be large and bold. And should occupy most the page.
- And more features if you want to be more creative. Don't make it complicated to operate but simple for children to use, modify settings and should be fun.
- It should work when I just copy and paste it in a html file.
